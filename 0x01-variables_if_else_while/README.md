## Project Works
1) [Positive or Negative]: Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
2) [The last digit]: Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n
3) [Lowercase Alphabets]: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4) [Lowercases & Upercases]: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5) [Omit q & e]: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
6) [Base 10 digits]: Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7) [Don't use Char Datatype]: Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
8) [Reverse Alphabet]: Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
9) [Hexadecimal]: Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
10) [Single digit Combinations]: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
11) [Two digits Combinations]: Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
12) [Three digits Combinations]: Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
13) [2 two-digits Combinations]: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
